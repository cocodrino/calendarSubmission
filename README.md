## My Calendar submission for Programmr.com

### this is a really old project (1 May 2014 ) with which I participated (and won) in programmr 

formerly the site of programmr published competitions for developers, this in particular was to develop a calendar from scratch and that was visually attractive.

it was developed in react and using the velocity animation library, at that time I was looking for a more flexible alternative to using css animations....

it is very simple but quite striking, remember that it was done 4 years ago (recently uploaded to github since it was only hosted on the programmr site)
